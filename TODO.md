Add a page on the site with a list of all the players who submitted

Add a way to request recorder role (you are allowed to react to a message if you have th role to take on that recording job in the discord)

The site will die if I dont have scaling in place (pre banning players from discord, auto upload VODS (python script), get more uploaders)
